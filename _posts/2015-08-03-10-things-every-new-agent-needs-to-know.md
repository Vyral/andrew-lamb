Today, I cover 10 things I wish I knew when I first got my real estate license. If you're a new agent, or an agent who is still trying to become a top producer, you might find these tips helpful. Let's jump right in:

{% include pullquote.html %}

**1. I wish I knew to focus my time on P-L-A-N.** This means Prospecting, Lead generation/followup, Appointments, and Negotiation. These are the only things in real estate that make you money, so focusing on them first thing every morning will help a lot.

**2. About 20% of the activities you do every day lead to 80% of your results, meaning money in your pocket.**

**3. Don't believe everything you hear,** especially when other agents say they're doing what works for them. Just know that most agents don't track their results and may think something is working even if it's actually costing them money.

**4. Master effective scripts and dialogues.** Don't be afraid to role play, because practice makes perfect. Make sure you are only saying what you need to say and practicing that with someone else before talking to live leads. Make sure you have it down before you go out and talk to potential clients.

**5. Develop lender relationships and leverage those relationships like crazy.** Some of the biggest and best referral sources are other business owners in town. Whether it's lenders, appraisers, or handymen, teaming up with professionals around town can really help your business!

**6. Forget farming and brand advertising.** All you really need to do is put out some kind of landing page or direct response marketing and get people to respond to an offer that actually brings value to them and puts them first. No one cares about who you are and why they should work with you; they just want to know what's in it for them! Focus on getting your information in front of someone and making an offer they can respond to.

**7. Go deep and not wide with your marketing.** So many agents end up spreading themselves too thin and get no results. Make sure you're investing your time and money into a few things that are going to work consistently, rather than testing 100 things and never getting true consistency or results from any of them.

**8. Find a mentor,** whether that means driving an hour to meet with one of the top producers in the area or paying a coach for real estate related advice that's personalized to your business. Find someone to learn from and copy their success. Real estate is really a pretty simple business, you just need to find someone who demonstrates results and profit every single year.

**9. Real estate as a practice is not a business.** You are now a business owner. You can't just come in to the office whenever you want or work without a purpose. You truly are responsible for doing dollar-producing activities and following up and tracking the results and numbers of your business. In other words, run your business like a business and you are sure to have success.

**. Do not chase squirrels.** Do not get distracted by all the phone calls you recieve from sales people and from all the ads targeting you trying to sell you shiny new objects to help your business. If you keep jumping from product to product, it's a surefire way to waste all of your money and get no results. You really just need to focus on a few key things and you will get the best results.

These are simple and easy tips to remember - I just wish I knew them when I first got my license.
