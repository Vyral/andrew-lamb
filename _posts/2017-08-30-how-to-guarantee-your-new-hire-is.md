Today I’m going to teach you how to guarantee that your new hire is productive from day one. You might be surprised to know that it’s not a difficult process. It comes down to following three steps:

**1. Define their 20%.** This is in reference to the 80-20 rule which states that 20% of dollar-producing activities make up 80% of your revenue. These activities include prospecting, lead follow-up, going on appointments, negotiating contracts, and practicing scripts. We ask our agents to do these things from day one because we want them to start making contacts right away.

**2. Create a path with milestones.** There should be a checklist for your new hire to follow every step of the way so they know what success looks like from the start.

**3. Check in daily and set up specific 30, 60, and 90-day checkpoints.** At each checkpoint, we make sure our new hires have completed their lists. They either did or they didn’t, so there’s no debate about whether they are on the path to success or not. A new agent on our team, Hannah, did a great job at hitting her goals by simply following our playbook and taking off.

If you have any questions for me at all, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
