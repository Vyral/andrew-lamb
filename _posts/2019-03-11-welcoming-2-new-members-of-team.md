As most of you know, we’ve been looking to fill a couple of roles here on our leadership team, the first being the broker of record. Well, I’m excited to let you know that we have identified our permanent broker of record! Currently, Pablo, our operating principle, is and will continue to be a designated Realtor—someone who can sign documents and act as a broker; however, we’ve always wanted someone local in the office to fill that role.

With our recent addition, we’ve been able to do that. Kathy Luebke, who recently joined our office, is excited to start in her role of broker of record. Kathy has 33 years of real estate experience, having started in Solano County and then later opening an office of her own in Napa. Eventually, she sold that office and came back to Solano County.  Now that she’s joined us, all of her experience, growth, and leadership skills have come with her.

Many of you likely met her when she attended our first event BOLD last summer as a guest, which speaks to who she truly is: She’s all about our culture, eager to learn and grow, and she’s excited to support you in compliance and the growth of your sales business.

The next position we were looking to fill was that of a market center administrator, and we’re pleased to announce that we succeeded there, as well: Iris Cruz will be joining us as our new market center administrator.

Iris has a degree in business administration and accounting. She was a staff accountant for four years before moving into a product specialist and technology role, in addition to being a certified trainer. With what we’re aiming to do with technology here at Keller Williams, she’s the perfect fit.

We are always building a bench, so if you have referrals for people who can fill those roles, we’d love to hear from them. In real estate, it’s good to have a couple of people in mind for depth positions, or positions that can be filled right away. If you know someone who would be interested in this opportunity, or if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us.
