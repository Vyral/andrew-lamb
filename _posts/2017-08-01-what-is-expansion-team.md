Expansion teams are real estate’s new frontier. They provide more opportunities for agents and clients alike.

Today I’m here to bring you some information about expansion teams, and how you can know whether they are something that could be right for you.

So, how is an expansion team different from a local real estate team? An expansion team is, essentially, a local team that has kept all of their core, or hub, services in one location, but finds sales agents in other markets.

For example, while I’m located in Vacaville, California, it isn’t at all uncommon for me to receive leads from other nearby markets like Napa.

Even though Napa is only about a 30-minute drive from Vacaville, a majority of real estate agents simply don’t want to commute. They also, oftentimes, feel uncomfortable working in a market they maybe don’t know as well as their immediate, local area. When this is the case, those agents usually refer the clients to a Napa agent instead.

The issue with this, though, is that eventually all those referrals add up to a lot of lost potential business. This is where the concept of an expansion team comes in.

Instead of referring clients out, a team receiving a lot of potential business from a given area might choose to hire an agent living in that area to do some of the footwork. And, because all of the administrative support is already taken care of, being an agent in this position can be a great opportunity.

So rather than just taking a 25% split for the referral fee, the way profit is shared can be negotiated within the team. Expansion teams, overall, are much more profitable as a business.

At Keller Williams, we’ve created a platform and a system that supports agents looking to expand their teams. Kristan Cole, the vice president of expansion with Keller Williams, has also come up with a lot of great tools and systems that will help agents launch into expansion.

This is a new frontier for real estate. It isn’t uncommon for businesses like Walmart or Costco, to expand, but the expansion of real estate teams is a relatively new thing.

If you have any other questions about expansion teams or our current real estate market, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
