Hey everyone, today we are very excited to announce a few brand new open positions with our team. Right now, we are looking for four qualified buyer's agents to join our team, as well as an executive assistant.

Thinking about a career in Northern California real estate sales?<br>
<a href="mailto:andrew@lambrealestate.com">Email me today for a private real estate career consultation.</a>
</div>

Our team has been growing rapidly and we have too many leads to handle on our own, so we are looking for four buyer's agents to service all of these leads. We have a 30-day fast start program, where we will get you caught up to speed on our company and teach you how we conduct business successfully. We expect all of our buyer's agents to succeed with our systems and expect them to make six figures. In fact, we guarantee that you will make at least $60,000 in your first year working with us as an agent, and if you don't, we will pay you the difference.

The other position we are looking to fill is for an executive assistant. We want someone who can really help us manage and support our team to the best of our abilities. We are looking for someone who can make sure the schedule is all taken care of.

If either of these positions sounds like an ideal fit for you or somebody you know, please give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to helping you advance your career!
