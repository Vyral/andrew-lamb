Today we’re talking about how you can stay busy during the holiday season to ensure you have a great start to 2016. At the end of the year, real estate tends to slow down in general across the country.

However, it doesn’t really happen that way in Northern California. Just last November, we had 6 closings. There are buyers and sellers out there, but not as many agents. The truth is that it’s the agents that slow down as opposed to the market.

The number one tip I have for you in order to have a good start to 2016 is to start getting everything under contract now, so you will see that money when the new year starts. Make sure you are following up on leads and calling past clients, this is a great time to dig in and show them you are working hard at a time of year when many aren’t. They will appreciate that.

Another thing you can do this time of year to really impress your clients is to hold a client appreciation event. We hold a free pie giveaway at our office and invite all our past clients and spheres to come and grab a free pie (which we get for $6 a piece at Costco) to show we are thinking about them and thankful for their business. This is a great referral tool.

As for how we keep busy within our team, we like to do a contest around this time of year called a “Go for no,” where you go out and ask as many people as you can, in person, whether you know them or not, and if they know anyone looking to buy or sell a home in the next year. The fear of asking this question is what keeps most people from getting referrals, and you’d be surprised about the answers you’ll get. It’s not about them saying yes, it’s about asking the question and being comfortable with them saying no.

Now is a great time to really build up those client relationships, spread your joy, and ask for referrals. If you have any questions for us or want to talk about what we do on our team to generate business this time of year, please feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to speak with you!
