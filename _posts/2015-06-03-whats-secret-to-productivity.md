Today, I just want to share a helpful tip that I use every day to help me be more successful. One thing I've noticed among successful people is those who really manage their time well seem to be the most successful. One thing I try to do each year is manage my calendar and manage my time, and to do that, I use something called the Dominate Your Day planner.

The goal of the Dominate Your Day planner is to free up time for you to do more dollar-producing activities. You need to prioritize activities that will generate business and get you closings so that you're not constantly reacting to the chaos that is the real estate transaction.

One cool thing about the Dominate Your Day sheet is it has a three-project focus that helps you determine what you're going to put your mind to throughout the week. If you accomplish those three things, you should be much closer to the goals you set at the beginning of the month or the beginning of the quarter.

You can also divide each day in 6 Must Do MONEY MAKING Activities. The first two are typically the things that bring in the most money, like bringing in new business or prospecting. The bottom four can be anything from negotiating a price reduction to setting followup appointments for people you're still trying to find homes for. Really, this part of the planner is for anything that gets us into contract or closer to a closing. Things like responding to emails or scheduling inspections should be done later in the day.

It's crucial to focus on the hardest things to do at the beginning of the day, while you have the most energy. You don't want to be interrupted by the whims of others, so it's very important to time block these important activities. The little things that aren't necessarily dollar-producing can be listed at the bottom of the Dominate Your Day planner under the Action Item List.  

The last thing to look at on the sheet is the Positive Focus...Go B-I-G or go home! section. This is an area where you can record your wins for the day. It's easy to get overwhelmed or bummed over a long day, so it's important to record every win you have throughout the day, every positive thing that happens to you.

If you would like a copy of this incredibly helpful planner, give me a call at (707) 301.8694. I would love to hear from you!
