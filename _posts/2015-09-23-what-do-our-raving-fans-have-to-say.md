Today I’m going to answer one of the most frequent questions we are asked: “How do we recruit raving fans in our business?” We have so many repeat and referral customers that continue to spread the word about our company, we wanted to share with you some of the strategies that have led us to get where we are out. Basically, it comes down to delivering a great customer experience and maintaining good relationships. We’ve got three key points to focus on today, here they are:

**1. Decide what you want your customer experience to be, and define it.**

For us, it’s very clear that our sellers want a proven, repeatable system to sell their home for up to 18% more than traditional methods. It’s a clear system that follows clear strategies. The same is pretty true for buyers, who want that proven, repeatable system that can save them tens of thousands in unnecessary costs.

**2. You’ve got to know your customer and what they want.**

We have specific client experiences we want to have with our buyers and sellers, and we have specific programs catered to each client. Every one of them is thinking “What’s in it for me?” so it’s our job to show them. When we approach how we want to interact with these people, it’s always about what’s in it for them, which is determined by knowing who they inherently are. We tailored all of our systems with our clients around these.

**3. Deliver, plus one.**

This is a phrase we like to use around here and it basically means going that extra step or extra mile for the client. Something that puts their experience over the top, like providing a free home warranty.

 When you add all of these elements together, that’s what creates a raving fan, who will refer business without being asked and be your biggest cheerleader when it comes to growing your business. We strive to create that Disney-like feel with our customers, and we want to be a place where people want to come buy and sell homes.

If you have any questions for us about our raving fans or about our business in general, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon!
