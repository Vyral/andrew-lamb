Our team is growing and we need help. We’re looking to add some new agents to help us take care of all the leads we have coming in each day.

Thinking about a career in Northern California real estate sales?<br>
<a href="mailto:andrew@lambrealestate.com">Email me today for a private real estate career consultation.</a>
</div>

Our team is growing here in Vacaville and we’re looking to add some new members. If you are a licensed agent in the area who is looking to double your business and take your career to the next level, we want to hear from you. Even if you only sold three homes last year, we can help. We have taken agents from three deals a year to upwards of 30 within 12 months.

We are looking for hard-working, growth-minded individuals to come join our team and work within our systems and models to double, triple, even quadruple their production. We want everyone on our team to be selling 30+ homes per year. We have way too many leads to handle and we need help.

We have a full-time transaction coordinator, a full-time listing manager, and all the support you could possibly need as an agent. We will even help you set appointments to fill up your calendar so you can meet with buyers and sellers to accomplish their goals and in turn, accomplish yours.
