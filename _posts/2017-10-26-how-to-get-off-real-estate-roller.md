There comes a point where the volume of business you’re receiving becomes slightly difficult to manage.

Trying to do a lot of business while simultaneously not being sure of who to hire to help you manage all of that business can put you on a real estate roller coaster, so to speak.

Imagine you’ve generated six leads, each with their own needs. Sometimes, servicing a number of leads at once can make it difficult to find the time to generate more. So, what happens when those six leads close?

At that point, you’re left at the bottom of the roller coaster. You go from six leads down to nothing instead of maintaining a constant stream of business.

When people try to balance lead generation with actually working with those leads, there is no time left for further lead generation and the whole process becomes inefficient.

One of the best ways to solve this problem is by joining a team—especially an expansion team. Doing this will give you more stability and leverage without sacrificing your income.

This is why expansion teams have become a core part of Keller Williams. An expansion team is able to handle the administrative process while agents do the footwork. Joining a team, especially an expansion team, leads to more stability and leverage without sacrificing income.

Expansion teams allow agents from across the country to work under a network of supportive, administrative staff that is in place so that they can focus on what they do best: helping clients to buy and sell homes.

Five Doors Network, the expansion team I’m part of, has 21 locations in 13 regions and as a result has been nominated for the 2017 Innovator Award for Most Innovative Team. But beyond that, there is simply a great level of financing available to put behind the core services.

At Five Doors Network, we put $2.1 million back into our hub so that we can better our services for clients and agents alike.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
