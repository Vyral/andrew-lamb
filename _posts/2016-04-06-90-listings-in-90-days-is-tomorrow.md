I wanted to take a moment to invite you to a great event we have coming up, 90 Listings in 90 Days. It couldn’t be more timely, as the spring market is starting to heat up! The buyers are out and looking for homes, but we’re short on inventory. As an agent, this makes your job more difficult.

That’s where Craig Reger comes in. He’s been selling real estate in Portland for more than 17 years, and he wants to share how he took his inventory from zero to 90 in only 90 days. The event is April 7, 8:30am, at Travis Credit Union. You don’t want to miss this great opportunity to learn how to become a more productive agent.

If you have any questions about the event, please don’t hesitate to reach to us. We’re always here to help!
