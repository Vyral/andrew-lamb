If you're starting out as a new agent, you need to utilize your sphere of influence. You need to figure out the 50-100 people that you're comfortable asking if they know anyone that's looking to buy or sell a home. Starting from there is easy, because it's not difficult to convince people that you know to work with you.

I always tell new agents to start playing a game called, Who Do I Know? You can look in a variety of places to begin this search.

Who do you know from past jobs? Who do you know from school? Look for people that you've shared experiences with, and find people that would be willing to help you.

This leads me to the next big question, which should be aimed at the people you're talking to. Ask them who they know that you should also know. This could be someone they know that simply has a shared interest. It doesn't need to be someone that's looking to buy or sell a home or someone who works with real estate.

It's also beneficial to ask them about contractors that they know because they own a home. These people make a living off of people buying and selling homes, and they are a good source of information on potential clients.

These people don't have to be friends, they can be acquaintances or just people that you run into at the grocery store.

Once you do have these 50-100 people, you need to put them in a contact relationship management system (CRM) so that you can continue to reach out to them in the future.

This is a great way for new agents to start building out contacts. If you have any questions about this, please don't hesitate to contact me!
